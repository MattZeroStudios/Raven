Raven is the software that will drive a Raspberry pi running Kali linux to allow for discrete data collection. The purpose of Raven is to collect and document networks, facilities, and other areas for vulnerabilities within a discrete backbag that will draw no attention to the user, since they will appear as a normal citizen using their phone. Along side Raven a Android app will be developed to control the raspberry pi and will come loaded with preconstructed attacks that can be carried out. Understanding the limitations of the raspberry pi platform in all its variants I have developed the solution. The solution being a robust and heavy computing machine availble to accept jobs from the Raspberry pi across the internet. Doing so will allow to extend battery life and efficiency of testing a network or facility since you will be able to offload that computational requirement to a server designed for heavy computing.
